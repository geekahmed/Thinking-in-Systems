# Chapter 1. The Basics
 - A system is an interconnected set of elements that is coherently
   organized in a way that achieves something.
 - Any system must contain: elements, interconnections, and a function
   or purpose.
 - Systems Examples
	 - Digestive System
		 - Elements: teeth, enzymes, stomach, and intestines.
		 - Interconnections: physical flow of food and chemical signals.
		 - Function or Purpose: break down food into its basic nutrients and to transfer those nutrients into the bloodstream while discarding unusable wastes.
	 - Football Team
		 - Elements: players, coach, field, and ball.
		 - Interconnections: game rules, coach's strategy, players' communications, and the law of physics.
		 - Function or Purpose: win games, have fun, get exercise, and get paid.
 - Systems can be embedded in systems, which are embedded in other systems.
 - A system is more than the sum of its parts. It may exhibit adaptive, dynamic, goal-seeking, self-preserving, and sometimes evolutionary behavior.
 - Many of the interconnections in systems operate through the flow of information. Information holds systems together and plays a great role in determining how they operate.
 - Purposes of systems are deduced from behavior, not from rehtoric or stated goals.
 - Information about the existence of a problem may be necessary but not sufficient to trigger action - information about resource, incentives, and consequences is necessary too.
 - Keeping sub-purposes and overall system purposes in harmony is an essential function of successful systems.
 - The least obvious part of the system, its function or purpose, is often the most crucial determinant of the system's behavior.
 -  System structure is the source of system behavior. System behavior reveals itself as a series of events over time.
 -  A stock is the memory of the history of changing flows within the system.
 - If the sum of infl ows exceeds the sum of outflows, the stock level will rise.
 - If the sum of outflows exceeds the sum of infl ows, the stock level will fall.
 - If the sum of outflows equals the sum of inflows, the stock level will not change â€” it will be held in dynamic equilibrium.
 - A stock can be increased by decreasing its outflow rate as well as by increasing its inflow rate.
