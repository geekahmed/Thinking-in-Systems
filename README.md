# Chapter 1. The Basics
 - A system is an interconnected set of elements that is coherently
   organized in a way that achieves something.
 - Any system must contain: elements, interconnections, and a function
   or purpose.
 - Systems Examples
	 - Digestive System
		 - Elements: teeth, enzymes, stomach, and intestines.
		 - Interconnections: physical flow of food and chemical signals.
		 - Function or Purpose: break down food into its basic nutrients and to transfer those nutrients into the bloodstream while discarding unusable wastes.
	 - Football Team
		 - Elements: players, coach, field, and ball.
		 - Interconnections: game rules, coach's strategy, players' communications, and the law of physics.
		 - Function or Purpose: win games, have fun, get exercise, and get paid.
 - Systems can be embedded in systems, which are embedded in other systems.
 - A system is more than the sum of its parts. It may exhibit adaptive, dynamic, goal-seeking, self-preserving, and sometimes evolutionary behavior.
 - Many of the interconnections in systems operate through the flow of information. Information holds systems together and plays a great role in determining how they operate.
 - Purposes of systems are deduced from behavior, not from rehtoric or stated goals.
 - Information about the existence of a problem may be necessary but not sufficient to trigger action - information about resource, incentives, and consequences is necessary too.
 - Keeping sub-purposes and overall system purposes in harmony is an essential function of successful systems.
 - The least obvious part of the system, its function or purpose, is often the most crucial determinant of the system's behavior.
 -  System structure is the source of system behavior. System behavior reveals itself as a series of events over time.
 -  A stock is the memory of the history of changing flows within the system.
 - If the sum of infl ows exceeds the sum of outflows, the stock level will rise.
 - If the sum of outflows exceeds the sum of inflows, the stock level will fall.
 - If the sum of outflows equals the sum of inflows, the stock level will not change â€” it will be held in dynamic equilibrium.
 - A stock can be increased by decreasing its outflow rate as well as by increasing its inflow rate.
 - A stock takes time to change, because flows take time to flow.
 - Stocks generally change slowly, even when the flows into or out of them change suddenly. Therefore, stocks act as delays or buffers or shock absorbers in systems.
 - Changes in stock set the pace of the dynamics of systems.
 - The time lags imposed by stocks allow room to maneuver, to experiment, and to revise policies that aren't working.
 - Stocks allow inflows and outflows to be decoupled and to be independent and temporarily out of balance with each other.
 - Most individuals and institutional decisions are designed to regulate the levels in stocks.
 - Systems thinkers see the world as a collection of stocks along with the mechanisms for regulating the levels in the stocks by manipulating flows.
 - A feedback loop is formed when changes in a stock affect the flows into ot out of that same stock.
 - Feedback loops can cause stocks to maintain their level within a range or grow or decline.
 - A feedback loop is a closed chain of causal connections from a stock, through a set of decisions or rules or physical laws or actions that are dependent on the level of the stock, and back again through a flow to change the stock.
 - A balancing feedback loop is a kind of stablizing, goal-seeking, regulating loop.
 - Balancing feedback loops are equilibrating or goal-seeking structures in systems and are both sources of stability and sources of resistance to change.
 - Reinforcing feedback loops are self-enhancing, leading to exponential growth or to runway collapses over time. They are found whenever a stock has the capacity or reproduce itself.
 - **Think about this: If A causes B, is it possible that B also causes A?**
 - Complex systems do much more than stay steady or explode exponentially or approach goals smoothly.

# Chapter 2. A Brief Visit to the Systems Zoo

 - One good way to learn something new is through specific examples rather than abstractions and generalities.
 - The information delivered by a feedback loop - even nonphysical feedback - can only affect future behavior; it can't deliver a signal fast enough to correct behavior that drove the current feedback. Even nonphysical information takes time to feedback into the system.
 - A stock-maintaining balance feddback loop must have its goal set appropriately to compensate for draining or inflowing processes that affect that stock. Otherwise, the feedback process will fall short of or exceed the target for the stock.
 - Complex behaviors of systems often arise as the relative strengths of feedback loops shift, causing first one loop and then another to dominate behavior.
 - Questions for testing the value of the model
	 - Are the driving factors likely to unfold this way?
	 - If they did, would the system react this way?
	 - What is driving the driving factors?
 - System dynamics models explore possible futures and ask "what if" questions.
 - Model utility depends not on whether its driving scenarios are realistic, but on whether it responds with a realistic pattern behavior.
 - Systems with similar feedback structures produce similar dynamic behaviors, even if the outward appearance of these systems is completely dissimilar.
 - A delay in a balancing feedback loop makes a system likely to oscillate.
 - Delays are pervasive in systems, and they are strong determinants of behavior. Changing the length of a delay may (or may not, depending on the type of delay and the relative lengths of other delays) make a large change in the behavior of a system.
 - We can't start begin to understand the dynamic behavior of systems unless we know where and how long the delays are.
 - Economics are extremely complex systems; they are full of balancing feedback loops with delays, and they are inherently oscillatory.
 - In physical, exponentially growing systems, there must be at least one reinforcing loop driving the growth and at least one balancing loop constrainting the growth, because no physical system can grow forever in a finite environment.
 - A quantity growing exponentially toward a constraint or limit reaches that limit in a surprisingly short time.
 - The higher and faster you grow, the farther and faster you fall. 
 - Nonrenewable resources are stock-limited. The entire stock is available at once, and can be extracted at any rate (limited mainly by extraction capital). But since the stock is not renewed, the faster the extraction rate, the shorter the lifetime of the resource.
 - Renewable resources are flow-limited. They can support extraction or harvest indefinitely, but only at a finite rate equal to their regeneration rate. If they regenerate, they may eventually be driven below a critical threshold and become, for all practical purposes, nonrenewable.
